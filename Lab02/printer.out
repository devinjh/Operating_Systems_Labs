Dear Professor O'Neil,

I am so sorry that I am unable to turn in my program at this time.
First, I ate a rotten potatoes, which made me turn blue and extremely ill.
I came down with a fever of 105. Next my silly pet giraffe must have
smelled the remains of the potatoes on my computer, because he ate it. I am
currently rewriting the program and hope you will accept it late.

Sincerely,
(your name here)
