Dear Professor O'Neil,

I am so sorry that I am unable to turn in my program at this time.
First, I ate a rotten potatoe, which made me turn turqoise and extremely ill.
I came down with a fever of 105. Next my cool pet elephant must have
smelled the remains of the potatoe on my computer, because he ate it. I am
currently rewriting the program and hope you will accept it late.

Sincerely,
The boys
